My name is Max, I hate boring stuff and I enjoy to automate everything I can, I like to study and learn new things and test my skills taking certification exams.

Since I don't have a good memory, this is the place where I will put my notes on my experiments and things I find interesting so that I can easily find them in the future and share them if they might be useful to someone.
