My name is Max, I'm an Italian guy and an IT System Engineer, I've started my career as a IT consultant finding from the beginning a special feeling with enterprise Unix OS and tecnologies, my first love was Oracle Solaris, I realiazed right away that this working experience would've been a bit more than a job.

I hate boring stuff and I enjoy to automate everything I can, I like to study and learn new things and test my skills taking certification exams.
