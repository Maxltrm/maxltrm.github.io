My name is Max, I'm an Italian guy and an IT System Engineer, I've started my career as a IT consultant finding from the beginning a special feeling with enterprise Unix OS and tecnologies, my first love was Oracle Solaris, I realiazed right away that this working experience would've been a bit more than a job.

I've left the legacy IT since some time and I work as a Cloud Engineer, my current job consists of managing, supporting and monitoring Cloud infrastructures based on Openstack and developing ansible automations for deploying cloud based applications.
I hate boring stuff and I enjoy to automate everything I can, I like to study and learn new things and test my skills taking certification exams.

I'm also a maker, I build evil mechanisms with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
